I made a website for all the meal recipes of the video game, Don't Starve Together! Whenever me and my friends hop on the game, we have to look up how to make recipes on the wiki, so I decided to dedicate a website to this to make it more convenient.
This was created in an effort to learn materialize (also tried out jquery), a basic css framework, you can see I tinkered with a lot of their JavaScript and CSS functions in the code. 

How to use:
1. Download as zip or clone
2. Unzip
3. Open index.html

Alternatively, open the link: https://stony-su.github.io/dont-strave-together-cookbook-website/
